Hello! I'm Bill, and this is my site. Here, I (sometimes..?) log progress on the various projects I'm working on.

Current projects:

## - Mobile tackling dummy for Cranbrook football.
A robotic tackling dummy for use in football practice drills. Inspired by the "Mobile Virtual Player (MVP)" by Dartmouth University Alumni.

## - Affordable desktop CNC router.

## - Discord bot for "Battlerite"
