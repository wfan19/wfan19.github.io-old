excerpt: A review of what I've done so far on the Mobile Tackling Dummy project. Part one of a two part series where I also look at my plan in the future.

So far this blog/website has almost exclusively been about my Chrome extension project, which is actually kind of funny, since I originally made this site for my two main projects: my tackling dummy and CNC router. However, those two projects had been previously on hold, since my dummy's parts were missing, and I'm not sure if I even will be pursuing the router project, as it depends on if I will win a grant from my school or not.

Anyways, enough rambling. When spring break ended, I finally got my hub motors and ESC's, so now, after the giant brick of a 36v battery has been sitting in my room for two months, I can finally get to testing!

I did this whole job with soldering on bullet connectors today, and I was about to post this write-up here: 

>Originally, the connectors on my ESC and my motor were incompatible. The ESC uses 3.5mm bullet connectors, those standard on almost all RC ESC's. I don't know what the hub motor used. Today, I soldered on the bullet connectors. It was quite a learning experience, I had never soldered wires before - only PCB's.

But then I realized: Nobody reading this would have any context! "What is this hub motor for?" "Why are you using a 36v battery?" "
