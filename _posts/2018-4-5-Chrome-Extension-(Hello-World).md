I'm a borderline Youtube addict; The site's like a drug to me. I waste hours of time on it, mindlessly absorbing the videos. I blame Youtube's fantastic recommendation algorithm, and my choice of music. Whenever I'm supposed to be studying, I want to put on my study music, which is on Youtube. I open <https://www.youtube.com>, and before I can look up the music, I see something that interests me on the home page, and down the rabbit hole we go...

I tried a bunch of things to solve this problem, but I was always defeated by a combination of my weak willpower and just the inaptness of the solutions. One of the ideas that I tried was a website blocker. However, none of the currently existing ones had all the features that I was looking for.

I wanted to be able to:
* Blacklist domains, but whitelist subdomains
	* Block Youtube, but allow for music
* Block websites on a schedule
* Restrict me from lifting the block early
* Hide Youtube recommendations


While some blocking software or extensions had some of the features listed, none had all four.

Lately, with my will for self-improvement renewed, I thought to myself:

#### Why not write my own extension?

Some research and learning later, here I am.
